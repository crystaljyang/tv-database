# tv-database

This program connects to a website which acts as a TV show database, where 
visitors can find information on TV shows, their episodes, and leave reviews. 
We have pages with 'Actor' and 'Director' information where users can find
TV shows directed by their favourite directors, or what shows their favourite actors
and actresses have acted in. In our implementation of this design, we combined the 
review and rating functionality into one, and users now leave ratings when they write
their reviews.
